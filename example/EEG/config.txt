# 0 filterbank, 1 mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, 2 ann, 3 wavelet.
#
# Then, if -1, a filename.
# Then, a label ("ExampleFilterbank").
# Then optionally, a number (for ANN: 0 means raw, 1 means log-linearized).
# Then, if ANN, a weights file ("trainANN.wts").
#
# Filenames and labels may not include spaces.
#
# numchans indicates a filterbank's width and the number of MFCC's.
